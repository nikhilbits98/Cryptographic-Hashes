Write up on Hash Tables chained with linked list:

1. Hash Table is a data structure used to store keys/value according to hash values.
2. hash Table is an array where each element of an array is a pointer to a linked list. (Separate Chaining)
3. Initially array is empty and gets populated as elements are added.
4. Hash functions are used to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched.
5. Good Hash Function is 
  a. Easy to compute 
  b. Gives uniform distribution of elements over the table
  c. Less probability of collisions.
6. The idea of hashing is to distribute entries uniformly across an array to get O(1) time complexity of find and insert.
7. Separate Chaining is one of the techniques used to resolve collisions ie when two elements get hashed to same index.
8. How it works:
  a. When any element is to be inserted, its index is found using Hash Function.
  b. A new node of linked list is initialized with element's value.
  c. If the computed index is empty, a pointer of this node is stored at the index.
  d. If there is already a pointer at that index, that pointer is used to traverse linked list and new node is added
     to that linked list.
  e. When element needs to be searched, linked list at index corresponding to its hash value is traversed and searched for that element.
9. Uniform distribution of elements over hash table ensures size of linked list is minimal and time complexity O(constant).
