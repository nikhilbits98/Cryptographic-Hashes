Write up on Hash Tables chained with linked list:

1. Hash Table is a data structure used to store keys/value according to hash values.
2. hash Table is an array where each element of an array is a pointer to a linked list. (Separate Chaining)
3. Initially array is empty and gets populated as elements are added.
4. Hash functions are used to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched.
5. Good Hash Function is 
  a. Easy to compute 
  b. Gives uniform distribution of elements over the table
  c. Less probability of collisions.
6. The idea of hashing is to distribute entries uniformly across an array to get O(1) time complexity of find and insert.
7. Separate Chaining is one of the techniques used to resolve collisions ie when two elements get hashed to same index.
