WriteUp on Hash Functions:

1. Hash Functions are basically some mathematical functions used to convert variable input to compressed fixed size output.
2. Output of Hash functions is called hash values or simply hash.
3. Hash functions are consistent i.e for same input they give same hash value everytime.
4. Hash Functons are said to be good or ideal if probability of collisions is less.
(Collision: When for different inputs x and y, hash values come out to be same i.e. h(x) = h(y). )
5. Some example of very simple hash functions for input x can be:
  a. h(x) = (ax+b) mod table_size   ;where table_size is size of hash table and a,b are constants.
  b. h(x) = (x mod p) mod table_size  ;where p is some prime number.
   Although hash functons in use are much more complex with very less probability of collisions.
6. There is an inbuilt hash functon in C++ library functional: hash<key> return hash value for input key.
